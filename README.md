## What Are Hooks in React?

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React features such as state and lifecycle methods in function components.

> They simplify your code, reduce boilerplate, and allow reuse of stateful logic via **custom hooks**.


## Classification of Hooks

### 1. State Management Hooks

| Hook         | Description                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `useState`   | Manage simple local state.               |
| `useReducer` | Handle complex or dependent state logic. |

---

### 2. Side Effect & Lifecycle Hooks

| Hook                | Description                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `useEffect`         | Runs side effects after render.                   |
| `useLayoutEffect`   | Runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.       |
| `useInsertionEffect`| Inserts logic before any DOM update (CSS-in-JS). |

---

### 3. Performance Optimization Hooks

| Hook              | Description                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `useMemo`         | Memoizes computed values.                       |
| `useCallback`     | Memoizes functions to prevent re-renders.       |
| `useTransition`   | Defer less urgent updates for responsiveness.   |

---

### 4. Reference and DOM Interaction Hooks

| Hook                   | Description                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `useRef`               | Store mutable refs to DOM or persistent values.  |
| `useImperativeHandle`  | Customize the instance value exposed to parent. |
| `forwardRef`           | Forward refs through components.                |

---

### 5. Context and Communication Hooks

| Hook                   | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `useContext`           | Access React context values.                 |
| `useSyncExternalStore`| For consistent updates from external stores. |
| `useDeferredValue`     | Defer non-critical updates for performance.  |

---

### 6. Debug and Utility Hooks

| Hook            | Description                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `useDebugValue`  | Display custom labels for hooks in React DevTools.     |
| `useId`          | Generate stable unique IDs for accessibility/hydration.|

---

## Summary for React Experts

Hooks are not just an alternative to class components — they're a **modern, powerful paradigm** that unifies the logic and structure of UI development.

React Hooks:
- **Encourage composition**
- **Improve code readability**
- **Streamline developer experience**
- **Enable powerful abstractions**

---

## Custom Hooks

React lets you define **custom hooks** to encapsulate and reuse logic. They must follow the **Rules of Hooks**:

- Only call hooks at the top level of components.
- Do not call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

Custom hooks are prefixed with `use` and combine one or more built-in hooks to model specific behavior.

```tsx
function useTimer(initial = 0) {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(initial);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => setTime(t => t + 1), 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}
```

---

## Conclusion

React Hooks are a powerful way to structure your components. Mastering them enables:

- Cleaner and more readable logic
- Better state and lifecycle management
- Improved performance
- More reusable and testable code

Explore them in depth and build your own custom hooks to level up as a React developer.

## Example 1

---
### Overview 1

This example demonstrates the `useState` hook for managing a numeric counter. The component:

- Initializes the state at `0`
- Increments the counter by 1 or 2
- Resets the counter to 0
---

### Code Breakdown

### Importing `useState`

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
```

React provides `useState` as a named export. It's essential for enabling local component state in functional components.

---

### Initializing State

```tsx
const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
```

- `counter` is the current value of the state.
- `setCounter` is the function to update that value.
- `useState(0)` initializes the counter with a value of 0.
- Type inference automatically sets `counter` as a `number`.

---

### Updating State with a Function

```tsx
const increment = (num: number): void => {
  setCounter(counter + num);
}
```

- This function increments the current `counter` by a dynamic value `num`.
- The `void` return type is explicit but not mandatory.
- `setCounter` triggers a re-render when the state changes.

---


### JSX and Event Handlers

```tsx
return (
  <div className='mt-5'>
      <h3>Counter: useState</h3>
      <span>Value: { counter }</span>
      <br/>
     <button  onClick={() => increment(1)} type="button" className="btn btn-primary mt-2">+1</button>
     <button  onClick={() => increment(2)} type="button" className="btn btn-primary mt-2">+2</button>
     <button  onClick={() => setCounter(0)} type="button" className="btn btn-danger mt-2">reset</button>
  </div>
);
```

- Three buttons call the increment or reset logic using arrow functions.
- `+1` and `+2` buttons call `increment(1)` and `increment(2)`, respectively.
- The `reset` button uses `setCounter(0)` to restore initial state.
- `className` is used for styling with Bootstrap or similar frameworks.

---


### TypeScript Integration

- `useState(0)` infers `number` type automatically.
- `increment` function explicitly declares the parameter `num: number` and return type `void`.
- Ensures strict type checking and better IDE support.

---

### Best Practices

| Practice                     | Why It Matters                                     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Use arrow functions in JSX  | Avoids unnecessary re-renders with inline logic    |
| Parameterize update logic   | Makes the function reusable and testable           |
| Clear naming conventions    | Improves readability (`counter`, `setCounter`)     |
| Reset logic separation      | Keeps UI behavior intuitive and predictable        |

---

### Conclusion 1

The `useState` hook is foundational in React. This example is a perfect stepping stone to master stateful logic in functional components.

Key takeaways:

- `useState` provides value and setter pair
- Re-renders are triggered automatically
- Functions like `increment` abstract logic for cleaner JSX
- TypeScript enhances safety and documentation

---

## Example 2

---

### Overview 2

We build a component that tracks a `User` object with properties `uid` and `name`. It simulates logging in and conditionally renders user data.

---

---

### Defining TypeScript Interfaces

```tsx
interface User {
    uid: string;
    name: string;
}
```

- Defines the shape of the user object.
- Enables type safety and autocompletion in `useState`.

---

### Setting Up Initial State

```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState<User>({
  uid: '',
  name: ''
});
```

- Initializes `user` as an empty object matching the `User` interface.
- The generic `<User>` ensures type safety.
- `setUser` updates the `user` state.

---

### Implementing Login Logic

```tsx
const login = () => { 
  setUser({
    uid: 'ABC123',
    name: 'Fernando'
  });
}
```

- When the `login` button is clicked, it sets the user object to hardcoded credentials.
- Could be replaced with a real API call in production.

---

### Conditional Rendering

```tsx
{
  (!user)
    ? <pre>Not found user:</pre>
    : <pre>{ JSON.stringify(user) }</pre>
}
```

- Displays different content depending on whether a user exists.
- Note: since `user` is always initialized (even if empty), this condition will always render the `user` object.
- A better check would be `!user.uid`.

---

### Rendering the Component

```tsx
return (
  <div className="mt-5">
      <h3>User: useState</h3>
      <button onClick={login} className="btn btn-outline-primary">login</button>
      ...
  </div>
);
```

- Includes a login button styled with Bootstrap.
- Displays user info in `<pre>` format using `JSON.stringify()`.

---

### Expert Notes

| Concern                     | Expert Practice                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Type inference              | Always declare type explicitly with `<User>` |
| Object checks               | Use `!user.uid` instead of `!user`       |
| Avoid magic values          | Store temp users in constants            |
| JSON rendering              | Ideal for debug, avoid in production     |

---

### Conclusion 2

This example demonstrates:

- Using `useState` with complex object types.
- Managing user login simulation.
- Conditional rendering based on object state.
- Best practices for type safety and readability.

---

## Example 3

---

### Overview 3

`useReducer` is a powerful React hook for managing complex state logic in a clean and predictable way. It provides an alternative to `useState` and is especially helpful when state transitions depend on previous state or involve multiple actions.

---

### Initial Setup

```tsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

const initialState = {
  counter: 10
}
```

- `initialState` defines the starting state of the `counter`.
- This state will be managed by our reducer function.

---

### Action Type Definition

```tsx
type ActionType = {
  type: 'increment' | 'decrement' | 'custom';
  payload?: number;
}
```

- `ActionType` is a union type defining valid `type` values.
- `payload` is optional and only needed for the `'custom'` case.

---

### Reducer Function Explained

```tsx
const reducerCounter = (state: typeof initialState, action: ActionType) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { ...state, counter: state.counter + 1 }
    case 'decrement':
      return { ...state, counter: state.counter - 1 }
    case 'custom':
      return { ...state, counter: state.counter + (action.payload || 0) }
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

### Key Concepts

- **Pure Function**: Reducers must be pure, without side effects.
- **Spread Operator**: `{ ...state, counter: ... }` ensures immutability by copying state.
- **Payload Usage**: `payload` allows dynamic updates like custom increments.

---

### What is useReducer?

- `useReducer` manages state with a reducer function.
- It returns an array: `[state, dispatch]`.
- `dispatch()` is used to send actions that the reducer interprets.

---

### Full Component: CounterRed

```tsx
export const CounterRed = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducerCounter, initialState);

  return (
    <>
      <div>Counter: {state.counter}</div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'custom', payload: 10 })}>Custom +10</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Output Behavior

| Action     | State Change        |
|------------|---------------------|
| Increment  | `counter += 1`      |
| Decrement  | `counter -= 1`      |
| Custom     | `counter += payload`|

---

### Best Practices

- Keep reducer functions pure and stateless.
- Use action types consistently and descriptively.
- Combine with TypeScript to ensure strong type safety.

---

### When to Use `useReducer`

- Complex state transitions.
- State updates based on previous state.
- Better testability and organization.

---

### Conclusion 3

React’s `useReducer` hook is a master tool for managing state transitions in advanced applications. Whether you’re building dynamic forms, reducers with multiple actions, or simply avoiding prop drilling, `useReducer` is a must-have in your React arsenal.
